<p> Intro: In this exercise we recreated a board game called “Circle the Cat”.</p>
<p> The board contains an 11x11 matrix of tiles, each tile can be either 'blocked' or free.</p>
<p> In the middle of the board there is a frog, your mission is to circle the frog with blocked tiles so that the frog will not be able to move.</p>
<p>Rules: It’s a game of turns between the user and the frog.</p>
<p> The user starts with choosing one unblocked tile and blocking it.</p>
<p> Afterwards, it's the frog's turn.</p>
<p> The frog will calculate the closest path to escape the board and will take the first step of this path.</p>
<p> If the user successfully blocked the frog from all sides: the user will level up to the next level.</p>
<p> If the frog managed to escape the board: the user will lose, after losing, the user will gain a random new level with the same amount of 'BLOCK_NUMBER' of tiles.</p>
<p>Note: It is not enough to trap the frog in a certain space.</p>
<p>The stage is won only if the frog has nowhere to go.</p>
